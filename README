Project5CDN

High Level Approach

In this assignment, we started by first defining our two servers for dns and http.
We then further iterated on the features for these two servers. This involved developing
scripts to deploy and test these servers. In the future we intend to further develop performance enhancing functionality
for these two servers, including active measurements on the dns server in order to select the best performing replica server.

Performance Enhancing Techniques so far:

- Caching on HTTP Server
- Cache on DNS Server
- Dynamic IP redirection on DNS Server based on Active Measurements
    - Uses a scamper server running on replicas to ping client


Challenges faced:
- The most challenging part of this assignment is in the construction of DNS packets. There isn't much clear documentation on the subject and so much of what was done is hardcoded based on the assignment specifications and looking at the packet structure in wireshark.
- The second challenge is utilizing scamper. Setting it up was pretty tricky and DNS look ups are a fair bit slower as a result of the extra overhead from connecting to the replicas to run scamper. 
- The third challenge has to do with the runCDN script. Getting a process to run correctly in the background thru ssh turns out to be nontrivial. If we just used '&', then the process would hang, the best solution we found is based on this stackoverflow page: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19996089/use-ssh-to-start-a-background-process-on-a-remote-server-and-exit-session
