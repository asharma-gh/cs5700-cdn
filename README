Project5CDN

High Level Approach

In this assignment, we started by first defining our two servers for dns and http.
We then further iterated on the features for these two servers. This involved developing
scripts to deploy and test these servers. In the future we intend to further develop performance enhancing functionality
for these two servers, including active measurements on the dns server in order to select the best performing replica server.

Performance Enhancing Techniques so far:

Right now we implemented caching on the http server. 

Challenges faced:

Currently the largest challenge we are facing involves verifying that our servers are correct. Testing in a networked
setting is a challenge in itself due to the large variety of situations that can occur that we are trying to take into
account in our design. For example, we want to make sure that our http and dns server function properly in the face of 
a crash, and can recover properly.
