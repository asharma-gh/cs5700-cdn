-- scripts to deploy code on EC2 instances

- DNS Server
- will require interpreting DNS packets
- will require some sort of server, probably a UDPServer from SocketServer module
    - need to think of strategy to find the optimal httpserver for a given request, load balancing stuff?
    - also would subsequently want to cache httpserver -> ip range mappings to reduce latency with lookups, with a TTL

- http server
    - by far the fastest way to persist cached data is using a mmap'd ds, but plaintext w/ csv is much faster to write
    -

- EC2 stuff
